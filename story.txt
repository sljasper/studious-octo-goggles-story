Once upon a time, there was a girl who had a pet horse. Kate loved her horse, buttercup
and they are best friends. 

20 years later Buttercup was aging much faster than her budding owner Kate.  Kate was 
working for a firm remotely and they wanted her to move to another branch in the city.
Buttercup was very upset and began crying.
