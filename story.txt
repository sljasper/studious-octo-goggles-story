Once upon a time, there was a girl who had a pet horse. Kate loved her horse, buttercup
and they are best friends. 

20 years later Buttercup was aging much faster than her budding owner Kate.  Kate was 
working for a firm remotely and they wanted her to move to another branch in the city.
Buttercup was very upset and began crying.

Kate's new destination did not have room for this beloved horse. Kate had to decide
between a job or her very old Buttercup. She didn't know what to do!
